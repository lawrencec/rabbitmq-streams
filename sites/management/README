This web application can be built and run using make or Maven 2.0.

make simply wraps Maven so Maven needs to be installed.

USING MAKE

To build everything type: make all

To run the web application on localhost:8080: make run


USING MAVEN

Firstly there are three libraries that aren't available on public maven 
repositories, scripts in the lib directory can be used to install these 
locally, do something like this:

> cd lib
> ./install-jcouchdb.sh
> mvn install:install-file -DgroupId=net.lshift.feedshub -DartifactId=feedshub-harness -Dversion=1.0 -Dpackaging=jar -Dfile=../../harness/java/feedshub_harness.jar

The make file will handle these install for you if you use it!


To build everything: mvn clean install

To run the web application on localhost:8080: mvn jetty:run
